Hey there!

I'm Cat. I write [blog posts on DEV](https://www.dev.to/catmcgeecode) and create [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7khnAAAID1WQ_4gQO73Gmw) about how to start your career in tech. I [tweet useful tips and threads](https://twitter.com/CatMcGeeCode/status/1278314269482930176) for junior developers and help bridge the gap between learning the basics and landing your first dev job. If I've helped you recently, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/catmcgee), [email me](mailto:catmcgee@hey.com), or give me a ‚ù§Ô∏è or a ü¶Ñ on [DEV](https://www.dev.to/catmcgeecode)!

### The Coding Interview

I'm building a project called [The Coding Interview](https://www.thecodinginterview.com) which, you guessed it, helps people prepare for the coding interview. It's a free web and mobile app with everything in one place - learn data structures & algorithms, practice coding challenges, and get experience with real interview questions. [Sign up for the newsletter](https://www.thecodinginterview.com) to be sent tips and tricks every two weeks, and be first to know about the beta release!

### JamSwiper

Another project that my Twitter followers are really excited about is [JamSwiper](https://www.jamswiper.com) (if you think of a better name, please [let me know](mailto:catmcgee@hey.com)!) It's a new way to discover music, and is what I like to call the Tinder of Spotify. You'll be played 30 seconds of a song, and can choose to swipe right or left. Swiping right will add it to a playlist on Spotify and update your recommendations, and swiping left will ensure you won't have to listen to that song again. Releasing in about 3 weeks.
